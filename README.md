# srt-now A fast tool to translate subtitle files

[🛒 Buy Now OR Watch Trailer – itch.io](https://itsmepal.itch.io/srt-now)

## Overview
This program takes .srt files from the src folder and translates them one by one according to your preferred language. You can change the language in `config.cfg` > `language` by writing your language code.
```ini
   [GENERAL]
   language= en
   ```
 The translated files will be automatically saved in the output folder, which opens automatically after translation.

## License Activation
To prevent software tampering and unauthorized copying on multiple devices in a single purchase:

> **⚠️ IMPORTANT:** License activation is mandatory for program functionality.

1. Before opening the main program file, you must run `verify.exe`
2. Copy the result that appears (your mac-address)
3. Send it to the developer from the same account you used to purchase
4. Within 30 minutes, you will receive a license-key
5. Add the license-key to your `config.cfg`:
   ```ini
   [AUTH]
   licenseKey= your-license-key-here
   ```
6. After this, you can use the tool normally without any problems

> **❌ Note:** If you don't complete these steps, the tool won't work.
